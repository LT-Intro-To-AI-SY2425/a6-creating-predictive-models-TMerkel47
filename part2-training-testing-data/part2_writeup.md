# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective since we use train test splitting which lets us use testing and training data making our model more accurate.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
It tells us why there is a 63% variation in the data.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
The model is accurate since the predicted values match the actual values fairly well however as age increases the model seems to get more inaccurate.
